# 3 AU Core v1.0.0-ballot


## 1.1 Capability Statement

<details>

<summary>Retrieve information about supported server functionality using the FHIR capabilties interaction.</summary>

# Background
The Capability Statement Sequence tests a FHIR server's ability to formally describe features supported by the API by using the [Capability Statement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html) resource. The features described in the Capability Statement must be consistent with the required capabilities of a AU Core **Responder**. The Capability Statement resource allows clients to determine which resources are supported by a FHIR Server. Not all servers are expected to implement all possible queries and data elements described in the AU Core API. The **AU Core Responder Capability Statement** requires that
    the Patient resource and **at least** one additional resource profile from the AU Core profiles.

# Testing Methodology
This test sequence accesses the server endpoint at `/metadata` using a `GET` request. It parses the Capability Statement and verifies that: * The endpoint is secured by an appropriate cryptographic protocol * The resource matches the expected FHIR version defined by the tests * The resource is a valid FHIR resource * The server claims support for JSON encoding of resources * The server claims support for the Patient resource and one other resource It collects the following information that is saved in the testing session for use by later tests: * List of resources supported * List of queries parameters supported

</details>

### Tests


#### 1.1.1 FHIR server secured by transport layer security
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

Systems **SHALL** use TLS version 1.2 or higher for all transmissions not taking place over a secure network connection.



</details>



#### 1.1.2 FHIR Server supports the conformance interaction
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

The conformance 'whole system' interaction provides a method to get the CapabilityStatement for the FHIR server. This test checks that the server responds to a `GET` request at the following endpoint: ``` GET [base]/metadata ``` This test checks the following SHALL requirement: > Applications SHALL return a resource that describes the functionality of the server end-point. [http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) It does this by checking that the server responds with an HTTP OK 200 status code and that the body of the response contains a valid [CapabilityStatement resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/capabilitystatement.html). This test does not inspect the content of the CapabilityStatement to see if it contains the required information. It only checks to see if the RESTful interaction is supported and returns a valid CapabilityStatement resource.



</details>



#### 1.1.3 Server is using FHIR R4
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

This test inspects the CapabilityStatement returned by the server to verify that the server is using FHIR R4.



</details>



#### 1.1.4 FHIR server capability states JSON support
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

FHIR provides multiple [representation formats](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/formats.html) for resources, including JSON and XML. AU Core profiles require servers to use the [JSON representation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/json.html): [```The AU Core Server **SHALL** Support json source formats for all AU Core Responder interactions.```](http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/0.3.0-ballot/CapabilityStatement-au-core-server.html#title) The FHIR conformance interaction require servers to describe which formats are available for clients to use. The server must explicitly state that JSON is supported. This is located in the format element of the CapabilityStatement Resource. This test checks that one of the following values are located in the format field. * json * application/json * application/fhir+json



</details>



#### 1.1.5 Capability Statement lists support for required AU Core Resource Types
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

The AU Core Implementation Guide states: ``` The AU Core Server SHALL: 1. Support the AU Core Patient resource. 2. Support at least one additional AU Core resources. ```



</details>



## 3.2 Patient Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Patient.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Patient sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Patient queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Patient as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* _id
* identifier

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s

</details>

### Tests


#### 3.2.1 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for Patient search by _id
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
_id on the Patient resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

## 3.5 Observation Body Height Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Body Height.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Observation Body Height sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Observation queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Body Height as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient + code
* patient
* patient + category
* patient + category + date

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s

</details>

### Tests


#### 3.5.1 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for Observation search by patient + code
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
patient + code on the Observation resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. AU
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

## 3.7 Observation Body Temperature Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Body Temperature.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Observation Body Temperature sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Observation queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Body Temperature as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient + code
* patient
* patient + category
* patient + category + date

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s

### Tests


#### 3.7.1 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for Observation search by patient + code
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
patient + code on the Observation resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. AU
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

## 3.9 Observation Waist Circumference Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Waist Circumference.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Observation Waist Circumference sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Observation queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Waist Circumference as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient + code
* patient
* patient + category
* patient + category + date

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s

</details>

### Tests


#### 3.9.1 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for Observation search by patient + code
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
patient + code on the Observation resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. AU
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

## 3.11 Observation Diagnostic Result Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Diagnostic Result Observation.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Observation Diagnostic Result sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Observation queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Diagnostic Result Observation as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient + code
* patient
* patient + category
* patient + category + date

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s

</details>

### Tests


#### 3.11.1 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for Observation search by patient + code
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
patient + code on the Observation resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. AU
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

# Background

The AU Core Condition sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Condition queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Condition as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. AU
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

## 3.17 MedicationRequest Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core MedicationRequest.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core MedicationRequest sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for MedicationRequest queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core MedicationRequest as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* patient
* _id
* patient + intent
* patient + intent + status

### Search Parameters
The first search uses the selected patient(s

</details>

### Tests


#### 3.17.1 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for MedicationRequest search by patient
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
patient on the MedicationRequest resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

If any MedicationRequest resources use external references to
Medications, the search will be repeated with
`_include=MedicationRequest:medication`.

This test verifies that the server supports searching by reference using
the form `patient=[id]` as well as `patient=Patient/[id]`. The two
different forms are expected to return the same number of results. AU
Core requires that both forms are supported by AU Core responders.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.

## 3.19 Location Tests

<details>

<summary>Verify support for the server capabilities required by the AU Core Location.</summary>

# Background

The AU Core Location sequence verifies that the system under test is
able to provide correct responses for Location queries. These queries
must contain resources conforming to the AU Core Location as
specified in the AU Core v1.0.0-ballot Implementation Guide.

# Testing Methodology
## Searching
This test sequence will first perform each required search associated
with this resource. This sequence will perform searches with the
following parameters:

* address
* name

### Search Parameters
Resources for this test group can't be found using patient search parameters. This means that in this particular case, the first test will be a read test, not a search. To ensure that this resource will be available for reading, please review the [prerequisites](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-core-inferno/blob/master/docs/pre-requisites.md

### Tests


#### 3.19.1 (SHALL) Server returns correct Location resource from Location read interaction
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support the Location read interaction.



</details>



#### 3.19.2 (SHALL) Server returns valid results for Location search by address
<details>

<summary>Show details</summary>

A server SHALL support searching by
address on the Location resource. This test
will pass if resources are returned and match the search criteria. If
none are returned, the test is skipped.

Because this is the first search of the sequence, resources in the
response will be used for subsequent tests.

Additionally, this test will check that GET and POST search methods
return the same number of results. Search by POST is required by the
FHIR R4 specification, and these tests interpret search by GET as a
requirement of AU Core v1.0.0-ballot.
